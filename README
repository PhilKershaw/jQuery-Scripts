jQuery Scripts that I've cobbled together for various projects - thought I'd share and hopefully help someone out.

jQuery.twitter-ticker.js:
Exactly what it says on the tin - a simple twitter ticker. Just add your username and it should work.
Not ideal code for high traffic site due to the 150 query per hour cap that twitter impose. However, you may be able to get round it with a developer API key. This solution isn't designed for that but feel free to fork and add it - submit a pull request and I'll merge the changes if it works.
